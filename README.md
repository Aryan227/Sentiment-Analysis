# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Bitcoin-Rates
This notebok contains 2 parts to the project. 

Formulation of 3 datasets:
1. Historical Data: This tracks bitcoin indices using the investpy library
2. Tweets collection: This is just a collection of all the tweets analyzed
3. Rate Checker: This tracks the sentiment in comparison with the bitcoin rates.

Data Analysis and Building a ML model:
As this was only scoped for about 10 days, the size of the dataset is small so the ML model performs with a below par accuracy. But given enough data it can scope out to one with higher accuracy. The ML model predicts a binary variable "Rise" that is 1 if the price rises and 0 if it drops.
